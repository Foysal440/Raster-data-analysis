Rasterio for geospatial data analysis in Python.
Raster data sets are difficult to handle, but the video explains how to get information, visualize, and save data in a custom format.
The first step is to install Rasterio, which is not available by default in Google Colab.
After installation, the package can be imported and used to read raster data sets, which can be uploaded in Google Colab.
Metadata about the raster data sets can also be obtained using Rasterio.
